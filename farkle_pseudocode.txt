Game will start by printing instructions for the game, initializing six dice and asking how many players. That input will be stored in a variable for number of players. 

For each player's turn the dice will be rolled. Dice will be a class that has methods roll, freeze and unfreeze. Player gets to decide which dice he wants to keep and which to roll again. 

If he can't keep any dice then he farkles and his turn is over and it moves to next player.

If the player does keep dice, they will be asked if they would like to continue to roll or end their turn.
When Player wants to stop rolling their turn is over and their score is calculated and added to their total, and it moves to next player.

Does user input their own total or does computer add it up for them?

First player to reach a score of 10,000 points or above wins.
